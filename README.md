## Overview
- Bali_Ai like a chat bot using Google AI Studio api,
can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

## Data Flow

1. The user enters a prompt or input in the frontend UI (e.g., a chat interface or input field).
2. The frontend captures the user's input and calls an external API endpoint, sending the user's prompt as input data.
3. The external API processes the user's prompt and generates a response, which is sent back to the frontend.
4. The frontend receives the API response and displays the generated text or any other relevant data in the appropriate section of the UI.
5. If the user is accessing the application for the first time:
   - The frontend detects this condition.
   - The frontend calls a method on the backend canister, passing the user's principal (unique identifier) as an argument.
   - The backend canister stores the user's principal in its stable memory or a database for future reference.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **dfx**: You have installed the latest version of the DFINITY Canister SDK, `dfx`. You can download it from the DFINITY SDK page. [installation guide](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/get_started.html#installation) 

- **Node.js**: You have installed Node.js, version 18 or above. You can download it from the Node.js website. nvm install v20.11.0


- **Google AI Studio**: The project uses Google AI Studio for generating questions and verifying feedback authenticity. The model used is `Gemini Pro`. You can get an API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/) for free.
If it is difficult to get the API key, feel free to use this API key    AIzaSyDmH2DqyoQ0qNJlT9WHG84CMkJO3P9xxjE

Please ensure all these prerequisites are met before proceeding with the setup of the project.

### Developing

Begin by opening a terminal window.

 ### Step 1: Navigate into the folder containing the project's files and start a local instance of the Internet Computer with the command:

`cd bali_ai`
`dfx start --background --clean`

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:


**Deploy the Local Internet Identity**: Run the following command to deploy the local Internet Identity:

```
dfx deploy internet_identity
```

**Deploy the Backend**: Follow the instructions in the backend README to deploy the backend.

```
dfx deploy backend
```

**Generate Backend**: 

```
dfx generate backend
```

**Deploy the Frontend**: 

```
npm start
```

# SSL/TLS Certificate Error Fix for Local Development

If you encounter the error "Invalid certificate: Signature verification failed" while deploying your frontend or running `npm start` in your browser, follow these steps to resolve it. This guide is specifically for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users.

## Steps

1. **Open your WSL terminal**

Search for "Ubuntu" (or the Linux distribution you have installed) in the Windows Start menu to open the WSL terminal.

2. **Install mkcert**

Run the following commands in the WSL terminal to install `mkcert`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools
curl -JLO "https://dl.filippo.io/mkcert/latest?for=linux/amd64"
chmod +x mkcert-v*-linux-amd64
sudo cp mkcert-v*-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mkcert
```

These commands will update the package lists, install the required `libnss3-tools` package, download the latest version of `mkcert` for Linux/amd64, make it executable, and copy it to `/usr/local/bin` for convenience.

3. **Install the local CA (Certificate Authority)**

Run the following command to install the local CA generated by `mkcert`:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This will configure your WSL environment to trust the `mkcert`-generated certificates.

4. **Generate the SSL/TLS certificate**

Run the following command to generate a certificate for `localhost`:

```bash
mkcert localhost
```

This will create two files: `localhost.pem` (the certificate) and `localhost-key.pem` (the private key) in your current working directory.

5. **Configure your development server**

Configure your development server (e.g., Vite, Node.js) to use the generated `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` files.

6. **Access the secured development server**

Open your browser on Windows and navigate to `https://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port your development server is running on (e.g., `https://localhost:5173` for Vite). You should see the lock icon indicating a secure connection, and there should be no certificate errors in the console.

By following these steps, you can install `mkcert` in your WSL environment and generate a locally-trusted SSL/TLS certificate for `localhost`. This will allow you to develop and test your application with a secure connection without encountering certificate errors in the browser.

**Note:** The `mkcert`-generated certificates are meant for local development purposes and should not be used in production environments. For production, you should obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
